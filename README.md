## Stack

Svelte kit with redis-cloud for short-term persistance.

## Developing

```bash
npm i -g pnpm
pnpm i

# start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
OR more simply just 
`npm run dev`

or you can cut npm out of the picture and run vite directly:

```
pnpm i --save-dev vite
vite dev
```

## Building

To create a prodlike version of the app:

```bash
npm run build

#or with vite
vite build
```

build results default to `./.svelte-kit`

if you want to run the whole app from a container, ensure Docker is installed and the daemon is running and then:

`docker build . -t [CHOSEN-TAG]` from the project root.

Run the container with `docker run --rm -it -p 443:443 [CHOSEN-TAG]` The site can then be accessed from the browser over https via localhost, and when you're finished testing you can kill the docker process with Ctrl-C or ctrl-Z like usual. 

Note: Docker should kill the container after exit, but if it doesn't you might get an error such as `Bind for 0.0.0.0:443 failed: port is already allocated.` - in this case, you just need to kill the existing container. Run `docker container ls` and feed the hash it spits out into `docker container stop [HASH]` and then you should be good to go again. This also works if you have trouble killing the running container.
